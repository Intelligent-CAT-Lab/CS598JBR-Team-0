    """A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 
    A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. 
    For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. 
    However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. 
    Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: 
    every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order. 
    For example, 630 is a composite number, but it can be rewritten as 2×3×5×7, and 15 can be rewritten asThe following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
